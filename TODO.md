* Step
    * focus
        * remove focus from any element at start of step (but what if it is the wanted behavior)
        * focus on the highlighted element
    * follow target if they move (actions or scroll)
* Window
    * improve auto placement
        * to avoid to be over secondary targets
        * to prefer left/right when target is at sides
    * Allow to move the window
    * change HTML
* Global
    * allow to have several instance of vue3-tutorial on the same page
        * do not return a singleton (labels, keyBinding)
