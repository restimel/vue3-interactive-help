> VueJS 3.X + Typescript + JSX + tutorial

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/vue3-tutorial.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vue3-tutorial)

## Introduction

A customizable component allowing you to propose a step by step tutorial on
your website or your web application.
User interacts directly with your interface and can be guided through your
most complex features.

It integrates well with VueJS and is reactive to option changes.

A tutorial scenario can integrate some optional steps, to adapt perfectly
with the current state and to provide a smooth experience.

It depends on only 1 lib ([VTYX](https://github.com/Intersec/vtyx) which is to use Vue3Â with strong typing) and so the package stays very light.

## Example

```html
<VTutorial
    :steps="[{}]"
    open
/>
```

## Features

* s
* CSS styles can be easily changed to fit your theme.
* Strong typing: all Typescript types are provided.
